## Animation Widgets

1. **AnimatedAlign**: Animates changes in alignment of a widget over a given duration whenever the alignment changes.

2. **AnimatedBuilder**: A general-purpose widget for building complex animations by separating the animation's computation and its visual representation.

3. **AnimatedContainer**: A container that gradually changes its values over a period of time, like color, border radius, and dimensions.

4. **AnimatedCrossFade**: A widget that cross-fades between two given children and animates itself between their sizes.

5. **AnimatedDefaultTextStyle**: Animates changes in a text style over a given duration whenever the text style changes.

6. **AnimatedIcon**: Shows an animated icon that can be animated between two states using an AnimationController.

7. **AnimatedList**: Provides an animated list that automatically animates items when they are inserted or removed.

8. **AnimatedModalBarrier**: A modal barrier that can be animated, useful for transitions where a modal barrier fades in or out.

9. **AnimatedOpacity**: A widget that animates changes in opacity over a given duration.

10. **AnimatedPadding**: Animates changes in padding over a given duration.

11. **AnimatedPhysicalModel**: Animates changes to a physical model's attributes such as elevation, color, and shape.

12. **AnimatedPositioned**: Animates changes in a widget's position within a Stack over a given duration.

13. **AnimatedPositionedDirectional**: Similar to AnimatedPositioned, but for widgets with directional positioning, taking text direction into account.

14. **AnimatedRotation**: Rotates a child widget over a specified duration when the angle changes.

15. **AnimatedScale**: Scales a widget over a given duration when the scale factor changes.

16. **AnimatedSize**: Automatically animates size changes of a child widget.

17. **AnimatedSwitcher**: Switches between two widgets with a cross-fade animation.

18. **AnimatedTheme**: Animates changes in the theme of the child widget tree over a given duration.

19. **AnimatedWidget**: A base class for building widgets that need to animate a value. Used in conjunction with an Animation object.

20. **AnimatedWidgetBaseState**: A base class for state objects that use an Animation to drive their rebuilds.

21. **DecoratedBoxTransition**: Animated version of a DecoratedBox that animates the changes to the decoration over time.

22. **FadeTransition**: Animates the opacity of a widget over time.

23. **Hero**: A widget that provides hero animations for transitioning between different routes.

24. **PositionedTransition**: Animates the position of a widget relative to its parent using a relative rect.

25. **RotationTransition**: Rotates a widget by a fractional value of a full rotation.

### These widgets offer a wide range of animation capabilities, from simple transitions to complex, custom animations, enabling you to create engaging and dynamic user interfaces in your Flutter applications.
